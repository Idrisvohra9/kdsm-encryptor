## (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ Before You Start

Please take a moment to read through these guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process. These guidelines help maintain code quality, consistency, and the overall vision of the project.

## (╯°□°）╯ General Guidelines

### 1. **Branch Management**

- **Always create a new branch** for your changes
- Use descriptive branch names:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode
  git checkout -b fix/encryption-bug
  git checkout -b docs/update-readme
  ```
- Never push directly to `main` or `develop` branches

### 2. **UI/UX Guidelines**

- **DO NOT modify the font family** - we maintain consistency across the application
- **Make all pages responsive** - ensure your changes work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Feel free to enhance the UI** according to your creative vision
- **DO NOT change theme colors** - maintain the existing color palette
- **Preserve the overall vibe** - keep the modern, security-focused aesthetic
- **Modify the existing components and make them feather light** - Coz, we want our platform to be as fast as possible!

### 3. **Code Standards**

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use JavaScript or TypeScript for all new files
- Ensure proper error handling
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write meaningful commit messages
- If you are a fellow vibe coder feel free to do so! but please try not to break anything （￣︶￣）↗　 

### 4. **Testing Requirements**

- Test your changes thoroughly across different devices
- Ensure no existing functionality is broken
- Add unit tests for new features when applicable
- Verify accessibility standards are met

## ಠ_ಠ Restricted Areas

### (╬ ಠ益ಠ) **DO NOT Modify `kdsm.ts`**

The core encryption algorithm in `kdsm.ts` is **off-limits** for direct modifications. This ensures:

- Algorithm integrity and security
- Consistent encryption/decryption behavior
- Proper testing and validation of cryptographic functions

**If you have suggestions for the KDSM algorithm:**

- Add comments in the file explaining your suggestions
- Open a GitHub Discussion to propose improvements
- Create an issue with detailed explanations and potential benefits
